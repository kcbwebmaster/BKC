  <p>Hello, Bahamas! I am Madison Forbes, your district governor for the 2023-2024 term. I am so excited to be serving you all this year. A little about me, I’ve been apart of Kiwanis for a very long time. I was in K-Kids, Builders Club, and now Key Club. So as you can see, I love me some service. Additionally, I love sports, for I play softball, volleyball, and dance! I also enjoy music being in piano for about 8 years. And when I’m not being sporty, doing service, or playing the piano, I’m probably watching a movie under my covers. Anyways, I cannot wait to work with you all this year! Prepare for a fun, service-filled year.</p>
